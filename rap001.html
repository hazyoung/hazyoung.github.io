    <p>Well he's in Indian Town, and what spots his eye?</p>
    <p>A nice looking Indian, and honey looked fly</p>
    <p>He had to talk because he just couldn't hack it</p>
    <p>She wore some moccasins and plus a tough leather jacket</p>
    <p>He trotted over and invented a line</p>
    <p>He said "Excuse me, um, do you happen to have the time?"</p>
    <p>All was on his mind was sex, sex, sex</p>
    <p>So she said "Why do ask? You got your own Timex"</p>
    <p>To poor old Dave that line was cold blooded</p>
    <p>He felt that her ego was way over flooded</p>
    <p>She started to laugh and then she started to say</p>
    <p>"I'm sorry some times I do get carried away</p>
    <p>I didn't mean to like ill treat you</p>
    <p>My name is Running Rabbit and I'm glad to meet you"</p>
    <p>He said "I'm Dave, with crazy clout"</p>
    <p>"Oh you're the one the girls keep talking about</p>
    <p>Yeah, you must be, because you look like a winne</p>
    <p>Come to my house, we'll discuss it over dinner"</p>
